### Considerations for the project
1. Should I use a SQLite database or should I locally host the databases using mySQL workbench
   - Using SQLite would allow the program to be used by others more easily

2. Should I create the application using electron or make it a website
   - I could techically do both and create a manual for those who want to run it with electron as an app
   - Electron seems more appealing as I could put it on my desktop but at the same time website would be more user friendly

3. According to chatgpt I can use python to locally host an SMTP server that I could use to send emails to myself
   - This could allow me to implement 2fa but I would need to locally host the backend (look into this further)
  
4. Use canva as a mock up?
   - This could be nice for documentation purposes so that I have an idea of what im trying to make
